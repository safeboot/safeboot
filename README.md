### Hello 👋
Hello! My name is Safeboot (also known as Jake or Sanjin Brajević) and I am a full-stack web developer. I work in Laravel and MySQL and I am the creator of projects such as Aurora and Kyoto. I started programming with HTML and CSS and now I work fully in Laravel but I am not afraid of expanding my horizons.
